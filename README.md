# Remote Work & Stress â€“ R Group Project

This project explores stress and burnout across job types in remote work settings using R. Conducted as part of STAT 4030: Programming in R, the analysis used synthetic survey data to investigate relationships between work arrangements, demographics, and mental health indicators.

## Objectives
- Analyze how remote work and job type influence stress and burnout
- Apply linear and logistic regression models to explore key predictors
- Visualize trends and evaluate model performance

## Tools & Techniques
- Data cleaning with `dplyr`
- Linear regression and ANOVA for stress level modeling
- Logistic regression for burnout prediction
- Visualization with `ggplot2`
- PMSE (Predicted Mean Squared Error) comparison for model evaluation

## My Contributions
- Led data cleaning and preprocessing for both datasets, including handling missing values and converting categorical variables
- Built and evaluated linear regression models to analyze stress levels
- Developed logistic regression models to predict burnout likelihood based on work arrangement and demographics
- Re-leveled factors and structured model inputs for interpretability
- Collaborated on analysis strategy and supported visualization development

## Key Findings
- Weak correlations between remote ratio and stress level
- No significant differences in stress by job role (ANOVA)
- Logistic regression showed interaction effects between age and work arrangement on burnout likelihood

## Limitations
The synthetic data had limited variation and some categorical imbalance, which constrained model significance. However, the project provided strong experience in data modeling, visualization, and collaborative analysis.

## Next Steps
Future work could explore real-world datasets (e.g., EPA, census), apply machine learning techniques, or build dashboards for policy insights.
